EmitDebugger
================

This is an assembly that generates a .il source file for emitted code with the correct breakpoints built-in for debugging purposes. It has the same binary interface with the Builder classes in System.Reflection.Emit to make it relatively painless to replace current code with this API.

Note that no more work is going into EmitDebugger.
